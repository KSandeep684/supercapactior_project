## üöÄ Project Overview

This capstone project is an interactive web application that serves as a virtual laboratory for analyzing and comparing energy storage technologies. It leverages a state-of-the-art **XGBoost machine learning model** to predict the performance of novel supercapacitors and integrates a **Large Language Model (Google's Gemini Pro)** to provide expert, AI-driven insights on the results.

The application is designed to accelerate materials science research by allowing users to simulate experiments and gain a deeper understanding of the trade-offs between different energy storage solutions.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This application is composed of two primary modules, accessible via tabs:

### 1. Supercapacitor Predictor
An interactive tool that allows users to:
- **Configure a Virtual Experiment:** Select from various electrode materials, electrolytes, and device types based on foundational research papers.
- **Predict Performance:** The XGBoost model predicts the **Charge Capacity**, **Discharge Capacity**, and long-term degradation over thousands of cycles.
- **Customize the Output:** View predictions as a single data point, a full degradation graph, or a detailed data table.
- **Generate AI Insights:** A cutting-edge feature where Google's Gemini Pro model acts as an expert materials scientist, providing a natural-language analysis of the prediction results and suggesting real-world applications.

### 2. Technology Comparison Dashboard
A high-level dashboard that compares four key energy storage technologies:
- Conventional Capacitors
- This Project's High-Performance Supercapacitors
- Commercial Lithium-ion (Li-ion) Batteries
- Emerging Sodium-ion (Na-ion) Batteries

The dashboard features clear, easy-to-understand bar charts for key metrics like **Energy Density**, **Power Density**, and **Cycle Life**, and concludes with an expert "Verdict" on the best use case for each technology.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Methodology

1.  **Data Foundation:** The project is grounded in experimental data extracted from three peer-reviewed research papers on supercapacitors.
2.  **Synthetic Data Generation:** A large, high-fidelity dataset was synthetically generated by intelligently interpolating between the sparse experimental data points to create smooth, realistic degradation curves.
3.  **Machine Learning Model:** Two **XGBoost Regressor** models were trained on this large dataset to predict charge and discharge capacity. XGBoost was chosen for its industry-leading accuracy and performance on tabular data.
4.  **AI Integration:** The **Google AI (Gemini Pro)** API is integrated to provide natural-language analysis, demonstrating a modern, hybrid AI approach.
5.  **Front-End:** The interactive web application is built with **Streamlit**, a powerful Python framework for creating data science and machine learning apps.
6.  **Deployment:** The application is deployed and hosted on **Streamlit Community Cloud**, making it publicly accessible.
